              As is the case with any other language, a person’s age has an
              effect on their ability to learn new ones. But that only means
              anyone can learn – no matter how old or young they are. Kids and
              young adults learn faster since they can easier pick up new
              accents and comprehend new sounds. Adults learn smarter as their
              attention spans are longer.

              The world has gone remote since 2020. Even if the pandemic hadn’t
              struck, it would have been a matter of time before the learning
              journeys went the digital route. Because let’s face it – the
              future of language learning is going to be increasingly
              contactless. People have lesser time than before to master it.
              Hence, they rely on platforms like Curiotory to pursue travel and
              career opportunities from the comfort of their own homes.

              It is possible to learn a little from various sources around you.
              For example, you may catch up on some phrases from songs you
              listened to or through something someone said during a TV show. To
              gain fluency in the language, however, you would need to gain a
              strong understanding of grammar along with general, linguistic,
              and pragmatic competencies. Doing that by yourself Is ten times as
              hard and would be just as long. By the end of it, there are no
              proper evaluation methods to assess where you truly stand.
